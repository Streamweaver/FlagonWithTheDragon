I just finished up a 30 day yoga challenge after discovering a great resource on YouTube.  There's a channel called [Yoga with Adriene](https://www.youtube.com/user/yogawithadriene) that I find accessible and it has a lot of varied content.  Better yet, it has a few different '30 days of ...' playlists.  I just finished up the initial [30 Days of Yoga](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLui6Eyny-UzwxbWCWDbTzEwsZnnROBTIL) playlist, mostly in July.  I really liked it, the routines vary from about 20 minutes to 30 minutes and are of varying difficulty, mostly skewing toward beginner.  Great for someone like me who works at home and can pop down during lunch.  

I finished up this 30 days and am back to a local yoga class sometimes during the week.  Having finished that playlist I'm going to start on the [Revolution: 31 days of Yoga](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLui6Eyny-Uzzl1q-GskVUZp6Fk8nIr9rK), and after that, the [30 Day Yoga Camp](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLui6Eyny-Uzx5BRNB2_Kvycrn5h9OsaHC) playlist.  Which should take me to the end of October or so.
